# Wearable-Tech Projects with the Raspberry Pi Zero
This is the code repository for [Wearable-Tech Projects with the Raspberry Pi Zero](https://www.packtpub.com/hardware-and-creative/wearable-tech-projects-raspberry-pi-zero?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781786468819), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.
## About the Book
With Wearable-Tech Projects with the Raspberry Pi Zero, you will begin with learning how to install the required software for your upcoming projects. You will also learn how to control electronic devices with the GPIOZero Python library. Next, you will be creating some stylish wearable-tech projects such as a motion-reactive LED cap and a Tweet-activated LED T-shirt.

Toward the end of the book, you will be creating some useful health and fitness wearable-tech projects; these will help you monitor your heart rate, track your movements with GPS, and count your footsteps with your own pedometer.

By the end of the book, you will have created a range of wearable-tech projects and learned enough about your Raspberry Pi Zero that you should be able to adapt these projects further or come up with your own creations!
## Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter02.



The code will look like the following:
```
while True:
    btn.wait_for_press()
    green.blink(0.5,0.5)
    red.blink(0.25,0.25)
    btn.wait_for_press()
    green.off()
    red.off()
